// The Cast Streaming Receiver, a peer corresponding to some Cast Streaming
// Sender at the other end of a network link.
//
// Cast Streaming is a transport protocol which divides up the frames for one
// media stream (e.g., audio or video) into multiple RTP packets containing an
// encrypted payload. The Receiver is the peer responsible for collecting the
// RTP packets, decrypting the payload, and re-assembling a frame that can be
// passed to a decoder and played out.
//
// A Sender â†” Receiver pair is used to transport each media stream. Typically,
// there are two pairs in a normal system, one for the audio stream and one for
// video stream. A local player is responsible for synchronizing the playout of
// the frames of each stream to achieve lip-sync. See the discussion in
// encoded_frame.h for how the |reference_time| and |rtp_timestamp| of the
// EncodedFrames are used to achieve this.
//
// See the Receiver Demo app for a reference implementation that both shows and
// explains how Receivers are properly configured and started, integrated with a
// decoder, and the resulting decoded media is played out. Also, here is a
// general usage example:
//
//   class MyPlayer : public cast_streaming::Receiver::Consumer {
//    public:
//     explicit MyPlayer(Receiver* receiver) : receiver_(receiver) {
//       recevier_->SetPlayerProcessingTime(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
//       receiver_->SetConsumer(this);
//     }
//
//     ~MyPlayer() override {
//       receiver_->SetConsumer(nullptr);
//     }
//
//    private:
//     // Receiver::Consumer implementation.
//     void OnFrameComplete(FrameId frame_id) override {
//       std::vector<uint8_t> buffer;
//       for (;;) {
//         const int buffer_size_needed = receiver_->AdvanceToNextFrame();
//         if (buffer_size == Receiver::kNoFramesReady) {
//           break;  // Consumed all the frames.
//         }
//
//         buffer.resize(buffer_size_needed);
//         openscreen::cast_streaming::EncodedFrame encoded_frame;
//         encoded_frame.data = absl::Span<uint8_t>(buffer);
//         receiver_->ConsumeNextFrame(&encoded_frame);
//
//         display_.RenderFrame(decoder_.DecodeFrame(encoded_frame.data));
//       }
//     }
//
//     // NOTE: An implementation may also want to schedule a timer to poll
//     // receiver_.AdvanceToNextFrame(), if skipping past late frames is
//     // desired. This would depend on the application, choice of codec, etc.

// "pointers" that indicate what assumptions and operations are made on certain
// ranges of frames in the queue:
//
//   1. Latest Frame Expected: The FrameId of the latest frame whose existence
//      is known to this Receiver. This is the highest FrameId seen in any
//      successfully-parsed RTP packet.
//   2. Checkpoint Frame: Indicates that all of the RTP packets for all frames
//      up to and including the one having this FrameId have been successfully
//      received and processed.
//   3. Last Frame Consumed: The FrameId of last frame consumed (see
//      ConsumeNextFrame()). Once a frame is consumed, all internal resources
//      related to the frame can be freed and/or re-used for later frames.
